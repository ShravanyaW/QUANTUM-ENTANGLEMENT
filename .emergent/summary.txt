<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a full-stack quantum entanglement website. The process involved understanding user requirements for Bloch spheres, histograms, and quantum circuits using Qiskit. An iterative approach was followed, starting with backend/frontend implementation, followed by testing and debugging. Key technical challenges included resolving missing Python dependencies like  and addressing API response formatting to ensure successful data retrieval. The work culminated in a functional API that correctly processes quantum simulations and generates visual data, including image base64, demonstrating a clear progression from initial setup to a working core functionality. The engineer demonstrated effective problem-solving by isolating issues and iteratively applying fixes, adhering to the specified technology stack.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement was to build a website for quantum entanglement. This application needed to display Bloch spheres, histograms, and quantum circuits, leveraging the Qiskit library. The initial request specified Flask for the backend, though the project was implemented with FastAPI as per system prompt guidelines. The previous engineer interpreted further user clarification (responses d, a, b to unstated questions) as a directive to construct a modern scientific dashboard with full interactivity and state vector visualization. The product's current state includes a functional backend capable of running quantum simulations, generating circuit images, and providing measurement results, with a basic React frontend to interact with these features.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for the backend.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the frontend UI.
- **Qiskit**: Quantum computing framework for simulations and circuit generation.
- **Qiskit-Aer**: Simulator for Qiskit circuits.
- **pylatexenc**: Required for drawing Qiskit circuits (MatplotlibDrawer).
- **Bloch Spheres, Histograms, Quantum Circuits**: Core features to be displayed.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the main FastAPI application file. It was initially read and then completely rewritten to include quantum simulation logic using Qiskit. It now handles API endpoints for running simulations, generating Bloch sphere, histogram, and quantum circuit data, and returning base64 encoded images/results.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component for the frontend. It was rewritten to provide the user interface for interacting with the quantum simulation backend, likely including buttons to trigger simulations and sections to display results.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains styles for the main React component. It was modified/rewritten to style the UI elements according to the design guidelines.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.js**: The entry point for the React application. It was also rewritten, likely for setting up the main application structure or routing.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Updated to include , , and  for backend functionality. This file ensures all necessary Python dependencies are installed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on debugging the quantum simulation functionality. Initial frontend interaction revealed that the simulation was not completing or displaying results correctly. Direct API testing uncovered a missing Python dependency, , which was crucial for drawing Qiskit circuits. After installing  and restarting the backend, a subsequent API test initially showed a . Further investigation confirmed the API was successfully returning a JSON response containing  data for quantum circuit visualizations and  for measurement results. The current state is that the backend API endpoint for quantum simulations is fully functional and returning expected data, including visual outputs. The next immediate step is to visualize these results on the frontend.
